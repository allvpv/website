In software engineering, the new often meets the old, and some things never
change for decades. Even though programming languages have rapidly evolved, the
overall scaffolding that OS gives for running the processes has been pretty
much the same since the days of Unix.

If you need to somehow parametrize your application at runtime by passing a
couple of ad-hoc variables (without creating temporary files or using some
custom solution involving IPC), you are doomed to use pretty awkward and
outdated interface:

## Environment variables (envvars).

There is no namespace to it, no types. Just a flat, embarassingly global
dictionary of strings.

### And they are everywhere.

Even a novice programmer is supposed to know them. (They saw it at some point,
maybe during a local setup that required exporting the `SECRET_API_KEY`, or
while building a Docker image).

But what really are those envvars? Is it some kind of a special map inside the
operating system? If no, then who owns them and how do they propagate? And what
can be stored inside them?


## Where do they come from?

In a nutshell: They are passed from parent to child.

```
    841 ?        00:00:00 sshd
   1520 ?        00:00:00  \_ sshd-session
   1616 ?        00:00:00      \_ sshd-session
   5521 pts/0    00:00:00          \_ bash
   5545 pts/0    00:00:00              \_ nu
   5549 pts/0    00:00:00                  \_ bash
   5560 pts/0    00:00:00                      \_ ps
```

In Linux, a program must use `execve` syscall to execute another program. When
typing `ls` in `bash`, as well as using `subprocess.run` in Python, or, at a
higher level, launching the code editor or web browser -- it all comes down to
`execve`, preceeded by `fork`. The familiy of `exec*` C functions also uses
`execve` underneath. And `execve` takes three arguments:

```c
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(execve,
		const char __user *, filename,
		const char __user *const __user *, argv,
		const char __user *const __user *, envp)
```

So, for `ls -lah` invocation in the terminal:
- the 1st argument will be `/usr/bin/ls`, the executable path,
- the 2nd argument will be `['/usr/bin/ls', '-lah']`, the array of command line
  arguments (the executable is usually the "zero" argument),
- the 3rd argument will be, for example `['PATH=/bin', 'USER=allvpv']`: the
  array of envvars, much longer in real life.

The default convention is to pass all envvars from the parent process to the
child process. However, nothing prevents the parent process from passing a
completely different (or even empty) set of envvars when using the `execve`
system call!

By default, however, all tooling passes the environment down: `bash`, as well
as Python (when you use `subprocess.exec`), or C library `execl` function, etc.
And this is what you expect to happen: the variables are inherited by the child
processes. That's the point ‚Äì to keep track of the *environment*.

## Where are they going?

After running the new program, the kernel just dumps the variables to the
memory on stack. It's just a sequence of null-terminated envvar definitions (if
you don't have a background in C, think of it as one big immutable `string`):

This static layout cannot be easily modified or extended: the program has to
copy those variables into some internal data structure.

Let's explore what underlying structure is used for storing the envvars in some
most essential programming tools/languages/frameworks. Out of curiosity, I've
checked the source code of them and came up with a brief description.

### Bash

It stores the variables in a ***hashmap***. Or, to be more precise, in a
***stack of hashmaps***. When you execute a process inside `bash`, `bash`
traverses the stack of hashmaps to check which variables are marked as
environmental, and copies them into an array passed to the child process.

> }
>

### The default C library on Linux: `glibc`

`glibc` creates a dynamic `environ` array; this array can be managed by
`putenv` and `getenv` library functions.

So the time complexity of `getenv` and `putenv` is *linear* regarding the
number of envvars. Remember ‚Äì envvars are not a high-performance dictionary and
you should not abuse them.

### Python

Python is an interesting case: it tightly couples it's environment to the C
library, which may lead to some unexpected problems.

If you programmed some Python, you've probably encountered the `os.environ`
dictionary.
On startup, the `os.environ` dictionary is built from the C library `environ`
array which is mentioned above.

But the dictionary values are **NOT** the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù of environment
variables for the child processes. Rather, each change to `os.environ` calls
the low-level, natively implemented `os.putenv` function, which in turn, calls
`putenv` from the C library.

> Note that the propagation is one-directional: modifying `os.environ` will call
> `os.putenv`, but not the other way around. Call `os.putenv`, and `os.environ`
> won't be updated.




## Liberal format

The Linux kernel, as well as the most popular standard C library on Linux -
`glibc` ‚Äì is very liberal when it comes to the format of environment variables.

For example, your C program (if it uses `glibc`) can manipulate environment ‚Äì
the global `environ` array ‚Äì in such a way that you'll create several
environment variables with the same name but of a different value. And when you
execute a child process, it will also retain this "broken" setup.

You don't even need the equal sign, separating the name from the value! The
usual entry is `NAME=VALUE`  but nothing prevents you to add
`NONSENSE_WITH_EMOJI üòÄ` to this array. (Is it even a *variable* then, without
a proper name and a value)?

So the kernel will happily accept any null-terminated string as an ‚Äúenvironment
variable‚Äù definition. It just imposes a *size* limitation:

- **Single variable**: 128Kb on a typical x64 Intel CPU. This is for the whole
  definition ‚Äì name + equal sign + value. It's calculated as [`PAGE_SIZE *
  32`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.24/source/include/linux/binfmts.h#L14).
  No modern hardware uses pages smaller than 4Kb, so you can treat it as a lower bound,
  unless you need to deal with some legacy embedded systems.

- **Total**: 2MB on the *typical* machine. This limit is shared by envvars and
  the command line arguments. The calculation is a bit more complicated (see
  `execve(2)` man page):

        max(32 * PAGE_SIZE,  min(MAX_STACK_SIZE / 4,  6 Mb))

  On a typical system, the limiting factor is the `MAX_STACK_SIZE`. Remember,
  initially the envvars are stored on the stack! To prevent unpredictable
  crashes, the system allows only 1/4 of stack for the envvars.


## Quirks

But the fact that you can do something, does not mean that you should.

For example, if you execute `bash` with the "broken" setup ‚Äì containing
duplicated names and entries without the `=` separator ‚Äì it will deduplicate
the variables and get rid of the nonsense entries.

One interesting edge case is a space inside the variable *name*. My beloved
shell ‚Äì Nushell ‚Äì has no problem with the following assignment:

    $env."Deployment Environment" = "prod"

Python is also perfectly fine with it. However, if you run `bash`, it won't be
able to reference such variable: a whitespace is not allowed in the variable
name!

Fortunately, the variable won't be completely lost ‚Äì bash will pass it down to
it's child processes. Bash even maintains a special hashtable ‚Äì `invalid_env` ‚Äì
just for that!


## The standard format

So what can be *safely* stored inside an envvar? A popular
misconception, repeated on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2821183), and by ChatGPT, is that
[POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) permits only **uppercase** envvars,
and anything beyond that is undefined behavior.

But this is seriously **NOT**
[what the standard says](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/):

> *These strings have the form name=value; names shall not contain the character
> '='. For values to be portable across systems conforming to POSIX.1-2017, the
> value shall be composed of characters from the portable character set (except

>

> Uppercase and lowercase letters shall retain their unique identities and

Yes, POSIX-specified utilities have uppercase envvars, but this is not
*prescriptive* for your programs. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúshall‚Äù, binding your applications
to that syntax. Quite the contrary: you are *encouraged* to use lowercase
letters for you envvar, because they won't collide with the standard "system"
tools. And all POSIX-compliant applications must preserve names of the envvars:
‚Äúapplications shall tolerate the presence of such names‚Äù. The only rule is that
the name cannot contain an equal sign.

But in reality, no one uses lowercase. The *proper etiquete* in software
development is to always use `ALL_UPPERCASE` env vars.

## In general, my recommendation is...

...to use `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$` for names, and UTF-8 for values. You should not
have any problems on Linux. If you want to be super safe, instead of UTF-8
stick to the POSIX mandated PCS (which is, essentially, ASCII without control
characters).
