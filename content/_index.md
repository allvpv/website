Hi! My name is Przemek Kusiak, and I use an alias which is as incomprehensible
as my name: **allvpv**. I live and work in üìç **Warsaw**, **Poland**.

I write about ‚ú® computers ‚ú®. Usually, I start my posts with a random rambling
or personal story, and then a technical part follows. If you found my blog
similar to [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), that's not by accident: I love her
blog and I am hevily inspired by it.

Peace! [Leave me an email](mailto:mail@allvpv.org), if you want to! Sometimes,
I post something on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/allvpv.org). And that's me:
