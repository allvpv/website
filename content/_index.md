Hi! My name is Przemek Kusiak, and I use an alias which is as incomprehensible
as my name: **allvpv**. I live and work in üìç **Warsaw**, **Poland**.

I write about ‚ú® computers ‚ú®. Usually, I start my posts with a random rambling
or personal story, and then a technical part follows. If you found my blog
similar to [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), that's not by accident: I love her
blog and I am hevily inspired by it.

Peace! Subscribe to my [RSS feed](/rss.xml). [Leave me an
email](mailto:mail@allvpv.org) if you want! Sometimes I post something on
[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/allvpv.org). And that's me:
